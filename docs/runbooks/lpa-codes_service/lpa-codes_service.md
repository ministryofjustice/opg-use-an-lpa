# Working with the LPA Codes API service

This command will start the lpa-codes service so you can mock and develop against it.

```shell
docker-compose -f ../opg-data-lpa-codes/docker-compose.yml --project-directory ../opg-data-lpa-codes/ up -d
```

This command will be replaced in future with a simpler mock of the lpa-codes service.
