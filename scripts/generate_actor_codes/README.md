# Generate actor codes

**NOTE:** In order to run this script, the following tools will be needed on a Mac:

- homebrew
- python
- jq: <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/>
- aws-vault, with your credentials set up : <https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault>
- you may need to refer to the onboarding instructions for AWS if you do not have an aws identity set up: <https://ministryofjustice.github.io/opg-new-starter/amazon.html>

This script starts an ECS task to generate Actor participant codes.

Install python dependencies with pip / pip3 (if you have python 3)

``` shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

you now have 2 options. you can do:

- **CSV file code generation**: for larger batches.
- **Inline code generation**: useful for a quick generation of a small number of codes.

for both options, the `<environment>` is the first part of the url e.g. demo or ULM222xyz for example.

**Running from a CSV file**: This option allows you to take a CSV file with an LPA code on each line similar to this:

``` text
700000000000
700000000001
..etc
```

We do some sanitising of the file to remove unexpected characters, dashes etc,
However, it is worth checking the file before running.

Command:

``` shell
./generate_actor_codes.sh -e <environment> -f </path/to/lpacodes.csv>
```

**Running inline**: This option is simply to allow inline running of the codes.

command:

``` shell
./generate_actor_codes.sh -e <environment> -i "<comma separated lpa uids>"
```

**Note:** The list of `comma separated lpa uids` must be surrounded by double quotes.

Both options have the `-v` option to switch on debug mode.

You will be given the chance to review the input, and cancel if needed.

Note: `${FILENAME}` prefix is in the `bash` date based format `<environment>_activation_codes_$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M)`.

``` log
environment name=<environment>
LPA Id's=<comma separated lpa uids, no spaces>
Total LPAs entered: <no of LPA uids - corresponding to the list count above>
environment name=357automateac
A new ${FILENAME}.txt will be generated.
This will be stored securely in disk image ${FILENAME}.dmg and copied to your Documents folder.
Are the above details correct? [y/n]:
```

hitting `y` will start the process off. You will see a log similar to below:

``` log

```

The script will then prompt for and re-enter a password to create the disk image.

This is copied to your `Documents` folder in a disk image named `${FILENAME}.dmg`.

Then:

- Send the encrypted image to the recipient by Slack or Keybase.
- Separately, let them know what the password is, e.g. via email.
