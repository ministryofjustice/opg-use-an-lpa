@actor @createAccessCode
Feature: The user is able to create access codes for organisations
  As a user
  I want to be able to create access codes to enable organisations to view my LPA
  So that I do not have to give them the paper LPA

  Background:
    Given I am a user of the lpa application
    And I am currently signed in
    And I have added an LPA to my account
    And I am on the dashboard page

  @ui @integration
  Scenario: As a user I want to be told if I have not created any access codes yet
    When I check my access codes
    Then I should be told that I have not created any access codes yet
    And I should be able to click a link to go and create the access codes

  @ui
  Scenario Outline: As a user I am to be shown the mistakes I make while creating an access code for an organisation
    When I request to give an organisation access
    And I have not provided required information for creating access code such as <organisationname>
    Then I should be told access code could not be created due to <reasons>
    Examples:
      | organisationname  |  reasons                          |
      |                   |  Enter an organisation name       |

  @ui
  Scenario Outline: As a user I want to be shown examples of organisations to create codes for based on my LPA type
    When I request to give an organisation access for my <lpaType> LPA
    Then I should see relevant <orgDescription> of organisations
    Examples:
      | lpaType | orgDescription                                                                 |
      | hw      | The organisation could be a hospital, care home, or other health care provider.|
      | pfa     | The organisation could be a bank, energy provider, or another business.        |

  @ui @integration
  Scenario: As a user I can generate an access code for an organisation
    When I request to give an organisation access to one of my LPAs
    Then I am given a unique access code

  # TODO This test actually does nothing. UML-1966
  @ui @integration
  Scenario: As a user I wouldn't be able to create a viewer code if the status of LPA has changed to Revoked
    Given The LPA has been revoked
    When I request to give an organisation access to the LPA whose status changed to Revoked
    Then I am taken back to the dashboard page
