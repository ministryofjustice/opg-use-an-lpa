Feature: Enter address on the Paper LPA
  As a user
  I would like the opportunity to enter the address on the LPA
  So that the cleansing team find it easier to check the validity of my request

  Background:
    Given I am a user of the lpa application
    And I am currently signed in
    And I have been given access to use an LPA via a paper document
    And My LPA has been found but my details did not match
    And My LPA was registered 'before' 1st September 2019 and LPA is 'not marked' as clean
    And I have provided my current address

  @ui
    Scenario: The user can enter the address on their paper lpa successfully
    Given I am asked for my address from the paper LPA
      When I input a valid paper LPA address
      Then I am asked for my role on the LPA

  @ui
   Scenario: The User is told to enter an address if they have left the field empty
     Given I am asked for my address from the paper LPA
     When I enter nothing
     Then I am shown an error telling me to input the paper address
