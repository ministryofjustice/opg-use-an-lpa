                    <p class="govuk-body">The Use a lasting power of attorney (LPA) service lets you create
                        ‘access codes’ to give to professionals or organisations so they can view an online summary of an LPA. For example,
                        financial institutions, medical professionals, and care organisations.</p>

                    <p class="govuk-body">The service is for donors and attorneys on an LPA.</p>

                    <p class="govuk-body">You should be able to use this service instead of showing someone the original paper LPA. </p>

                    <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold"> ! You cannot use a download or print out of the LPA summary in place of the
                        original paper LPA or instead of giving someone an access code</p>

                    <p class="govuk-body">By using this service you agree to these terms of use and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/help/terms-conditions">GOV.UK terms and conditions</a>.</p>

                    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Your responsibilities as an attorney</h2>

                    <p class="govuk-body">If you’re an attorney, remember that using this service to give someone access to a summary of the LPA, is the same as using the original paper LPA.</p>

                    <p class="govuk-body">When using an LPA you must always follow the legal responsibilities you agreed to when you signed the LPA. For example, you must always:</p>
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                        <li>follow the principles of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mental-capacity-act-code-of-practice">Mental Capacity Act</a></li>
                        <li>take into account any instructions or preferences the donor set out in their LPA</li>
                        <li>act in the best interests of the donor</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Your account security</h2>

                    <p class="govuk-body">When you create an online account for this service, use a valid email address and choose a strong password that someone else will not be able to guess easily.</p>

                    <p class="govuk-body">It’s your responsibility to keep your sign-in details safe. You should not use a shared email address to create your account. Do not share your password with anyone or write it down.</p>

                    <p class="govuk-body">You’re responsible for all activity on your Use a lasting power of attorney service account. We keep a record of activity for security and anti-fraud purposes.</p>

                    <p class="govuk-body">We recommend that you sign out of your account when you’re not using the service. We’ll automatically sign you out if you’ve not used the service for 60 minutes.</p>

                    <p class="govuk-body">If you download or print a copy of the LPA summary, make sure you keep the information safe and secure.</p>

                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Use access codes responsibly</h3>

                    <p class="govuk-body">When you give someone an LPA access code, you’re giving them access to personal information about the donor and attorneys on an LPA.</p>

                    <p class="govuk-body">Keep access codes secure. Only give access codes to professionals and organisations you trust and who have an appropriate need to view the LPA.</p>

                    <p class="govuk-body">We’re not responsible for how personal information, accessed using a code you’ve created, is used, shared, or held.</p>

                    <p class="govuk-body">If you lose a code or are worried a code may be used by an unauthorised person, you can cancel the code within the service.</p>

                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Access the service securely</h3>

                    <p class="govuk-body">You’re responsible for accessing the service securely. You should not access it using a computer or network that may leave personal information accessible to others or you think may be insecure. For example, you should not:</p>
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                        <li>leave a computer unprotected while you’re using the service</li>
                        <li>access the service using a shared or public computer</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Keeping your information safe</h2>

                    <p class="govuk-body">Any information you submit will be stored securely and used inline with our <a class="govuk-link" href="#">privacy notice</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#">cookie policy</a>.</p>

                    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Let us know if you want us to change the LPA</h2>

                    <p class="govuk-body">When professionals and organisations view the LPA summary, it’s important they see up to date information.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">Let the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) know if <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/power-of-attorney/change-your-lasting-power-of-attorney">changes need to be made to information in an LPA</a>.
                        We’ll then update the lasting power of attorney register and make the changes for you to the online summary.
                    </p>

                    <p class="govuk-body">For example, you should let us know us if:</p>
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                        <li>the donor or an attorney changes their name or address</li>
                        <li>the donor wants to remove an attorney</li>
                        <li>an attorney dies or can no longer act</li>
                        <li>the donor wants to cancel their LPA</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="govuk-body">Once you’ve let us know about a change, it may be a few days before this shows on the online service.</p>

                    <p class="govuk-body">Please let us know if changes need to be made as soon as you can.</p>

                    <p class="govuk-body"><b>Only the Court of Protection can change a registered LPA</b>. You must not make changes to the paper LPA with a pen, correction fluid or in any other way.
                        This applies to all changes, even small things like correcting a spelling mistake in someone’s name. If you change the LPA, you may not be able to use it anymore.</p>

                    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">The online summary</h2>

                    <p class="govuk-body">Screenshots, downloads or print outs of the online LPA summary are not proof of an LPA and may not show the latest status of an LPA.</p>

                    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Governing law</h2>
                    <p class="govuk-body">These terms of use are governed by the laws of England and Wales, including:</p>
