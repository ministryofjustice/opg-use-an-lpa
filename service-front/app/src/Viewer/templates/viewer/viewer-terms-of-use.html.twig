                <p class="govuk-body">The Use a lasting power of attorney (LPA) service lets donors and attorneys share a summary of an <abbr title="lasting power of attorney">LPA</abbr> with professionals or organisations by creating a unique ‘access code’.
                    View a lasting power of attorney is the part of this service that lets you see a summary of an <abbr title="lasting power of attorney">LPA</abbr>, using the access code given to you by the donor or an attorney.
                    This part of the service is for professionals or organisations providing a service to the donor. For example, financial institutions, medical professionals, and care organisations.
                    You can use this service instead of asking to see the original paper <abbr title="lasting power of attorney">LPA</abbr>.</p>

                <p class="govuk-body">By using this service you:</p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>agree to these terms of use and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/help/terms-conditions">GOV.UK terms and conditions</a></li>
                    <li>confirm that a donor or attorney wants you to view the <abbr title="lasting power of attorney">LPA</abbr> and has given you an access code</li>
                </ul>
