                <p class="govuk-body">The Use a lasting power of attorney (LPA) service lets donors and attorneys share a summary of an LPA with professionals or organisations by creating a unique ‘access code’.
                    View a lasting power of attorney is the part of this service that lets you see a summary of an LPA, using the access code given to you by the donor or an attorney.
                    This part of the service is for professionals or organisations providing a service to the donor. For example, financial institutions, medical professionals, and care organisations.
                    You can use this service instead of asking to see the original paper LPA.</p>

                <p class="govuk-body">By using this service you:</p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>agree to these terms of use and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/help/terms-conditions">GOV.UK terms and conditions</a></li>
                    <li>confirm that a donor or attorney wants you to view the LPA and has given you an access code</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">! It can be a criminal offence to use someone’s personal information without their permission.</p>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Information security</h2>

                <p class="govuk-body">You and your organisation are responsible for your use of View a lasting power of attorney.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">If you download a copy of an LPA summary, or record details of the summary, <b>your organisation becomes the ‘data controller’ of that information.</b> This means your organisation will be responsible for keeping the information safe and secure, in line with Data Protection Act 2018.</p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Accessing the service securely</h3>

                <p class="govuk-body">You’re responsible for accessing the service securely. You should not access it using a computer or network that may leave personal information accessible to others or you think may be insecure. For example, you should not:</p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>leave a computer unprotected while you’re using the service</li>
                    <li>access the service using a shared or public computer</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="govuk-body">We recommend that you close the tab on your web browser when you’ve finished using the service. We’ll automatically return you to the service start page if you have not used the service for 60 minutes.</p>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Keeping information up to date</h2>

                <p class="govuk-body">LPAs can change. For example, attorneys may change, people’s names or addresses may change, or the donor may cancel their LPA.</p>

                <p class="govuk-body">We use OPG’s records about registered LPAs to keep this service up to date. However:</p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>we rely on donors and attorneys to tell us about any changes</li>
                    <li>once we’re told about a change, it may take several days before we update the LPA summary on the service</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">The online summary</h2>

                <p class="govuk-body">Any screenshots, downloads or printouts of the LPA summary are not proof of an LPA and may not show the latest status of an LPA.</p>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Tracking use of the service</h2>

                <p class="govuk-body">We keep a record of when an access code has been used to view an LPA. This information is available to the donor and attorneys.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">The information will be stored securely and used in line with our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.lastingpowerofattorney.service.gov.uk/privacy-notice">privacy notice</a> and cookie policy.</p>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you suspect fraud or abuse</h2>

                <p class="govuk-body"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/report-concern-about-attorney-deputy">Contact the Office of the Public Guardian</a> if you have concerns about the actions of an attorney. For example, if you’re concerned they’re misusing a donor’s money or are making decisions that are not in the donor’s best interests.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">If you suspect abuse, a criminal offence, or think someone is in immediate danger, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-police">contact the police</a> first.</p>
